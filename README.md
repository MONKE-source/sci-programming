mini mini github instructions/tutorial for ethan by arth

not all inclusive, please learn on ur own

steps to edit  
1. git pull --> VERY IMPORTANT so that you dont have to deal with merging and conflicts  
2. git clone url --> clone it into ur own computer
3. open in vsc and edit 
4. git add . --> stages all the files, can specify file instead of writing
5. git commit -m "commit message" --> commits the files that were added
6. git push origin main --> pushes commits to the repository  

in case want to do branches
1. git branch branch-name --> create a new branch
2. git switch branch-name --> change to branch then just commit from there
3. git status --> check which branch on

others:
- git checkout commit-code --> checkout a specific commit
What not to do!

- DO NOT COMMIT ur temperorary files
- DO NOT edit the file at the same time as someone else to prevent conflicts
